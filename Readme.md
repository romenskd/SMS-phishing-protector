# üì± SMS Phishing Protector

**SMS Phishing Protector** is a JVM-based system for detecting and blocking phishing SMS messages in real time. It was created as a prototype for a telecom operator that partnered with a banking association to protect subscribers from fraudulent links in text messages.

## ‚ö° Why SMS Phishing Protector?

- **Production-Ready** ‚Äì Designed for fast deployment and low maintenance costs
- **Cloud-Native** ‚Äì Ready for Kubernetes, AWS, or standalone setups
- **Lightweight & Scalable** ‚Äì Modular microservices with clean APIs
- **Cost-Effective** ‚Äì Optimized use of paid external APIs via caching

## Architecture Overview

SMS Shield is composed of four microservices:

| Service                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SMS Ingestion**        | Ingests and processes incoming/outgoing SMS in JSON format                  |
| **Phishing Control**     | Detects phishing URLs via Google Web Risk API with database and Redis cache |
| **User Service**         | Manages opt-in/out preferences via START/STOP SMS commands                  |
| **Notification Service** | Sends alerts or logs about blocked phishing attempts                        |

## System design

## üîç How It Works

1. All incoming SMS messages are ingested in JSON format:
    ```json
    {
      "sender": "234100200300",
      "recipient": "48700800999",
      "message": "Visit https://www.m-bonk.pl.ng/personal-data to confirm your info."
    }
    ```

2. The `Phishing Control` service scans the message for URLs.
3. The system checks the URL:
    - First in Redis cache
    - Then in the internal database
    - If not found, calls the **Google Web Risk API**  
      ([API Reference](https://cloud.google.com/web-risk/docs/reference/rest/v1eap1/TopLevel/evaluateUri))
4. If the URL is malicious, the SMS is **blocked**.
5. Users opt-in or out by sending **START** or **STOP** to a predefined short number.
6. Actions are logged and optionally sent via the `Notification Service`.
